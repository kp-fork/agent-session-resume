# Cookbook

This cookbook shows practical ways to use `agent-session-resume` with Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, and OpenCode.

The skill's job is to make your prompt small. You name the prior agent/session source; the skill handles transcript discovery, full reading, task classification, and continuing from the true stopping point.

## Expected First Response

Every resume should begin with:

```text
Brief context summary
Task status breakdown
Clear next action
```

Only after that checkpoint should the agent continue implementation.

## Claude Code

Recommended install is the Claude Code plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add hacktivist123/agent-session-resume
/plugin install agent-session-resume@hacktivist123
/reload-plugins
```

Use the namespaced plugin command:

```text
/agent-session-resume:agent-session-resume
```

### Continue The Most Recent Claude Code Session

```text
/agent-session-resume:agent-session-resume

Continue the most recent Claude Code session for this repository.
```

The skill should inspect project-local `.claude/` first, then user-level Claude Code history such as:

```text
~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl
~/.claude/history.jsonl
```

`history.jsonl` is useful as a locator and prompt-history clue, but the full transcript is the source of truth.

### Continue A Named Claude Code Session

```text
/agent-session-resume:agent-session-resume

Continue the Claude Code session titled "Fix checkout retry flow".
```

### Continue From A Specific Claude Transcript

```text
/agent-session-resume:agent-session-resume

Continue from ~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl.
```

## Codex

For Codex, the short prompt should be enough:

```text
Use $agent-session-resume.

Continue the most recent Codex session for this repository.
```

Codex transcripts are usually stored in the user-level Codex home, not in each repository:

```text
${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/session_index.jsonl
${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/*.jsonl
${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/archived_sessions/*.jsonl
```

The agent should choose the most recent transcript whose cwd, workdir, repo path, thread name, or mentioned files match the current repository.

### Continue A Codex Session From Claude Code

Start Claude Code with access to Codex's user-level session store:

```bash
claude --add-dir ~/.codex
```

Then prompt:

```text
/agent-session-resume:agent-session-resume

Continue the most recent Codex session for this repository.
```

### Continue From A Codex Handoff File

```text
Use $agent-session-resume.

Continue from ./handoff.md.
```

Best practice: before switching agents, ask Codex to write a short handoff file into the repo.

## Antigravity

Use this when you have Antigravity artifacts such as task lists, plans, walkthroughs, screenshots, recordings, or exported summaries.

```text
Use agent-session-resume.

Continue the Antigravity task from the saved artifacts in this repository.
```

If you know the artifact path:

```text
Use agent-session-resume.

Continue from ./artifacts/antigravity-walkthrough.md and ./artifacts/task-list.md.
```

The agent should prefer an exported transcript when present, but artifact evidence is often enough to reconstruct:

- original user request
- plan
- completed implementation steps
- verification evidence
- review comments
- next unfinished task

## OpenCode

Use exported sessions, share links, summaries, or project-local OpenCode configuration.

```text
Use agent-session-resume.

Continue from this OpenCode session export.
```

If the repo has OpenCode configuration:

```text
Use agent-session-resume.

Continue the most recent OpenCode session for this repository.
```

The agent should inspect:

```text
opencode.json
.opencode/
```

When the `opencode` CLI or SDK is available, the agent should prefer supported session access over scraping private storage.

## Cross-Agent Handoffs

The main pattern is:

1. Install the skill in the receiving agent.
2. Give the receiving agent access to the prior transcript, handoff file, or artifact folder.
3. Use a short resume prompt.
4. Require the checkpoint before edits.

Before switching agents, ask the current agent for a compact handoff instead of pasting a full transcript:

```text
Create a compact handoff for the next coding agent. Include only the goal, completed work, in-progress work, not-done work, changed files, commands run, verification, exact stopping point, and next action. Redact secrets and customer data.
```

### Claude Code Continuing Codex

```bash
cd /path/to/project
claude --add-dir ~/.codex
```

```text
/agent-session-resume:agent-session-resume

Continue the most recent Codex session for this repository.
```

### Codex Continuing Claude Code

```text
Use $agent-session-resume.

Continue the most recent Claude Code session for this repository.
```

If Codex cannot access `~/.claude`, provide a project-local handoff or add the Claude history directory to the allowed workspace.

### Any Agent Continuing From A Handoff File

```text
Use agent-session-resume.

Continue from ./handoff.md.
```

## Good Handoff File Template

When leaving one agent and moving to another, ask the first agent to create:

```text
# Handoff

## Goal

## Completed

## In Progress

## Not Done

## Files Changed

## Commands Run

## Verification

## Exact Stopping Point

## Next Action
```

Keep the headings stable so another agent or validator can check the handoff shape. The repo includes a lightweight validator for this template:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate-handoff.py path/to/handoff.md
```

### Redaction Rules

Cross-agent handoffs should carry task evidence, not private data. Before sharing a handoff or turning it into a fixture:

- Replace API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, and bearer values with `<redacted>`.
- Replace customer names, emails, IDs, and private URLs with placeholders unless they are essential to the bug.
- Summarize large logs instead of pasting full output.
- For Claude Code sidecars or Codex tool outputs, include the command, result, and relevant error lines rather than raw files.
- Add a short redaction note when sensitive values were removed.

### Minimal Handoff Example

```text
# Handoff

## Goal

Finish checkout retry handling.

## Completed

- Added retry helper in `src/checkout/retry.ts`.
- Focused retry tests pass.

## In Progress

- Webhook replay path still needs inspection.

## Not Done

- Full checkout integration suite has not been run.

## Files Changed

- `src/checkout/retry.ts`
- `tests/checkout-retry.test.ts`

## Commands Run

- `npm test -- tests/checkout-retry.test.ts` passed.

## Verification

- Focused tests passed; integration coverage is still missing.

## Exact Stopping Point

Stopped before checking whether webhook replay should reuse the retry helper.

## Next Action

Inspect webhook replay, reuse the helper if needed, then run the full checkout integration suite.
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Do not resume from a summary when a full transcript is available.
- Do not pick the newest global session if it belongs to another repo.
- Do not mark planned work as `DONE`.
- Do not edit before the checkpoint.
- Do not reinstall both Claude plugin and standalone Claude skill unless you intentionally want duplicate command suggestions.
